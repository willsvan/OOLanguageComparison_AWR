# Swift
Swift, while very clearly not a strictly _functional language_, does have some of the features that one would expect when programming in a functional paradigm.
### Immutability
Swift allows us to make any type immutable by simply doing the assignment with the `let` keyword. Variables assigned as such can never be modified after their creation
### Map, Filter, Reduce
We have access to three of the mainstays of functional iteration in swift: map, filter, and reduce. These can be used to work with collections in a functional manner rather than the more procedural option of for-in loops. 
### First Class Functions
Swift has full support for first class functions, one of the most basic requirements of a functional language. Functions in Swift can be treated like any other type - assigned, passed, reassigned, and so on. \

# Go
Go, put simply, is _not_ a functional language. While it does provide first class functions, it lacks any strong support for immutability or functional operations on collections. While some of the ideas of functional programming might be useful in structuring your Go applications, it would be nearly impossible to do any true functional programming in Go.
