# Swift 

Swift is fundamentally both procedural and object oriented. You can choose to emphasise the object oriented side of the language, use procedural practices, or do both. 

# Go

Go is totally procedural, it does not solve problems through objects or classes like object oriented languages. It is also not functional, as it uses its procedural nature to create mutable values.
